  h1 FCC Project - API Basejump: Timestamp microservice

  p User stories:
  ol

    li I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)

    li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

    li If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

  p Example usage:
  ul
    li #[a(href="https://fcc-timestamp-e.glitch.me/December 15, 2015", target="new") 'https://fcc-timestamp-e.glitch.me/December 15, 2015']
    li #[a(href="https://fcc-timestamp-e.glitch.me/December%2015,%202015", target="new") 'https://fcc-timestamp-e.glitch.me/December%2015,%202015']
    li #[a(href="https://fcc-timestamp-e.glitch.me/1450137600", target="new") 'https://fcc-timestamp-e.glitch.me/1450137600']
